    <h3><u>Why Astronomy is so much popular?</u></h3>
    <p>
      Before the Internet, if you had a question about how to start engaging in astronomical pursuits, you had three avenues to get your answers:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Buy a book and trudge through technical jargon, spending half your time looking words up in a dictionary and re-reading previous pages, trying to wrap your head around the difference between declinations and constellations.
        </li>
        <li>
          Subscribe to Sky & Telescope, or another publication, and spend half your time reading the book from issue #1, trying to get up to speed on just what they’re talking about.
        </li>
        <li>
          Talk to someone you knew who owned a telescope and could mentor you... OK, so you really only had two roads to take, because NO ONE you knew owned a telescope or knew how to use one.
        </li>
      </ul>
      In the infancy of the Internet, there were budding websites and chat rooms that you could visit for advice. Now, with high-speed access, websites, and apps, if you have any question, there’s already someone who has asked it, and has had it answered. And there’s probably a video about it. A quick Google search and you’re on your way, and entire communities of people are eager to help you get started.
      <br />
      <br />
      It used to be that if you were a kid and you wanted a telescope, your parents would either say that you were crazy if you thought they were going to spend a ton of money on a passing phase… or they’d get you a special from the mall. Unfortunately, either choice was horrible for you. The cheap ’scopes were more than useless and drove you away from astronomy and into the waiting arms of video games.
      day.
      <br />
      Today, a decent ’scope can be had at a price that won’t make parents break out in hives, which might even have a motorized and computer-controlled mount.
      <br />
      <br />
      This really could’ve been the #1 reason, but I wanted to end big. Back in the olden days of the 20th Century, science kids were ridiculed and derided. But that’s changing. Being smart is cool, and now we can speak in public (figuratively, if not literally) about our favorite nebula or galaxy. We can go online and find astronomy clubs, we can find like-minded people all over the Internet to talk to, ask questions, engage in debates, and just be ourselves.
